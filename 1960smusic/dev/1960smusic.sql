('home', '<h1>The British Invasion</h1>\r\n<p>Music in the 60’s might be best known for the “British Invasion”. What was the British Invasion? During this time, music groups originating from England for the first time experienced breakthrough success in the United States. Some of the most notable bands include The Beatles, The Animals, and The Rolling Stones. The Beatles, who are considered to have created the breakthrough, are also one of the best selling rock groups of all time.</p>\r\n<p>The 1960’s also saw the rise of more subgenres of rock music including psychedelic rock, folk rock, blues rock, roots rock, and surf rock. Folk rock, for example, usually include politically charged lyrics and messages. Bands such as Bob Dylan, The Mamas and The Papas, and Simon and Garfunkel are just a few bands that were included in this genre. Other rock sub-genres, such as Psychedelic Rock, were influenced by not only by folk rock, but also by the drug culture that was prevalent throughout the decade. Psychedelic rock groups include bands such as The Grateful Dead, The Doors and the The Byrds. The Beach Boys, are one of the most popular Surf Rock bands from this decade. </p>\r\n<p>Other than rock, R&B and soul music began to gain mainstream popularity. This, large part, was due to the formation of Motown Record Corporation. Established in 1960, this label provided R&B and soul groups the promotion needed to achieve popularity. Motown Record Corporation included acts such as The Jackson Five, The Supremes, The Temptations, and The Marvelettes. </p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Top musicians of the 60’s.</h1>\r\n<p>The 60’s were full of amazing musicians. Among the top artists are Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, The Supremes, The Beach Boys, The Rolling Stones, Ray Charles, Janis Joplin, The Four Seasons, The Animals, Peter, Paul, and Mary, Jimi Hendrix, and The Who. From the the British Invasion, to psychedelic rock, and R&B classics, the 60’s had some of the greatest artists of all time. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<em>References:</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~mwaltos/lis506/project/1960s/music.html" target="_blank">http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~mwaltos/lis506/project/1960s/music.html</a></li>\r\n<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960s_in_music" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960s_in_music</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>'),

There was their erudition, their stock of language, their lore in urban sagas, their ransacking of every literature, their knowledge of archaeology and racial history- of kitchen midden and skull measurements. There was the precision with which they knew the homely and workday details of culture as well as the big abstraction, the ease with which they moved about in history from neolithic times to the report of the latest congressional committee.\n\nThey were, as has been said, "The last group who knew everything"- and if they did not know quite everything they could distract your attention from the gap by a wry witticism. There were their strange songs, any one of which could have made a lesser band''s career and each of which had the knack of standing the accepted doctrines on their head. There was their polysyllabic language and their slow acid style that corroded the sanctities. There were their conce, with their mumbled messages which only the better souls understood. There was the way they looked: shaggy eyebrows, ashen faces with unforgettable eyes, rough clothes that hung too loosely on their shrunken bodies, a shell of silence into which they seemed to have retreated for good and from which only the most persistent strategy could draw them.\n\nThey refused to be patronized or dismissed, turned into a cult or giggled at.

There was the precision with which they knew the homely and workday details of culture as well as the big abstraction, the ease with which they moved about in history from neolithic times to the report of the latest congressional committee.\n\nThey were, as has been said, "The last group who knew everything"- and if they did not know quite everything they could distract your attention from the gap by a wry witticism. There were their strange songs, any one of which could have made a lesser band''s career and each of which had the knack of standing the accepted doctrines on their head. There was their polysyllabic language and their slow acid style that corroded the sanctities. There were their conce, with their mumbled messages which only the better souls understood. There was the way they looked: shaggy eyebrows, ashen faces with unforgettable eyes, rough clothes that hung too loosely on their shrunken bodies, a shell of silence into which they seemed to have retreated for good and from which only the most persistent strategy could draw them.\n\nThey refused to be patronized or dismissed, turned into a cult or giggled at.

(38303, 'Passe', 'Tex Beneke', 'Friends, this is Tex Ritter with a strange story about a soldier boy and a deck of cards,\nDuring the North African campaign, a bunch of soldier boys had been on a long hike and they arrived in a little town called Casino. The next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to church. A sergeant commanded the boys in church and after the Chaplin had read the prayer the text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took them out. But this one boy only had a deck of card and so he spread them out. The sergeant saw the cards and said, â€œSoldier, put away those cards.â€ After the services were over the soldier was taken prisoner and was taken before the provost marshal. The marshal said sergeant, â€œWhy have you brought this man here?â€ â€œFor playing cards in church, Sir.â€ â€œAnd what do you have to say for yourself son?â€ â€œMuch, Sirâ€ replied the soldier. The Marshal said, â€œI hope for if not, I shall punish you more than any man was ever punished.â€ The soldier said, â€œSir, I have been on a march for six days and I had neither bible or prayer book, but I hope to satisfy you, Sir, with the purity of my intentions.â€ With that the boy started his story.\n\nYou see sir when I see the Ace, it reminds me that there is but one God. And the deuce reminds me the bible is divided into two parts, the Old and the New Testament. And when I see the three, I think of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. When I see the four, I think of the four evangelists who preached the gospel, there was Mathew, Mark, Luke and John. And when I see the five it reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps. There were ten of them, five were wise and were saved and five were foolish and were shut out. And when I see the six it reminds me that in six days God made this great heaven and earth. And when I see the seven it reminds me that on the seventh day God rested from his great work. And when I see the eight, I think of the eight righteous people God saved when he destroyed this earth. There was Noah, his wife, their three sons and their wives. And when I think of the nine, I think of the leapers our savior cleansed and nine of the ten didn''t even thank him. When I see the ten, I think of the ten commandments God handed down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the king, it reminds me that there is but one king in heaven, God all Mighty. And when I see the queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is queen of heaven. And the Jack or knave is the Devil.\n\nWhen I count the number of spots of a deck of cards I find three hundred and sixty-five, the number of days in a year. There are fifty-two cards, the number of weeks in a year. There''s four suits, the number of weeks in a month. There''s twelve picture cards, the number of months in a year. There are thirteen tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter,\nSo you see, Sir, my deck of cards serves me as a Bible, almanac, and prayer book. And friends I know that story is true cause I knew that soldier.'),

Those of the boys who had a prayer book took,\nThem out, but this one boy had only a deck of cards, and so he spread,\nThem out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said, "Soldier, put away those,\nCards." After the services was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and,\nBrought before the Provost Marshall.\n\nThe Marshall said, "Sergeant, why have you brought this man,\nHere?" "For playing cards in church, Sir." "And what have you to say for,\nYourself, son?" "Much, Sir," replied the soldier. The Marshall said, "I,\nHope so, for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever,\nPunished." The soldier said, "Sir, I have been on the march for about six,\nDays. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy,\nYou, Sir, with the purity of my intentions." And with that, the boy,\nStarted his story.\n\n"You see Sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there,\nIs but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into,\nTwo parts, the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey, I think,\nOf the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four, I,\nThink of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew,,\nMark, Luke and John. And when I see the Five, it reminds me of the five,\nWise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were,\nWise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the,\nSix, it reminds me that in six days, God made this great heaven and,\nEarth. When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God,\nRested from His great work. And when I see the Eight, I think of the,\nEight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was,\nNoah, his wife, their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine, I,\nThink of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine out of the ten didn''t,\nEven thank Him. When I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God,\nHanded down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King, it,\nReminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I,\nSee the Queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is Queen of,\nHeaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number,\nOf spots on a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year.\nThere are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits, the,\nNumber of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards, the number of,\nMonths in a year. There are 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter.\nSo you see, Sir, my pack of cards serves me as a Bible, an Almanac and a,\nPrayer Book..\n\n"And friends, the story is true.
